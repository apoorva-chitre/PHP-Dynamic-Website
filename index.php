		<h1>Franklin's philosophy of Fine Dining</h1>

		<p>At Franklin's Fine Dining, the focus is on seafood and steak, utilizing fresh & sustainable ingredients. All soups, stocks, sauces, and desserts are made in house under the watchful eye of Chef Franklin DiMario. His style reinterprets many classic recipes, while also creating new favorites and award winners including our clam chowder that won The Big Taste competition of Hawaii.</p>

		<p>Oh, and you can call us Frankie's You're Family here.</p>
